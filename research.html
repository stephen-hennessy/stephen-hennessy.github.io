      Moving Home: Non-Market Insurance and Labour Market Risk
    </div>

    <p>
      In 2023, more than half of renter households spent above 30% of their gross income on housing costs. 
      Non-discretionary spending such as housing exacerbates consumption losses while unemployed and induces self-insurance via moving home with a close family member. 
      This labour market insurance motive is evidenced in Kaplan (2012) which shows non-college young men aged 17-22 use the option to move home with a parent as a form of labour market insurance. 
      I use data from the Health and Retirement Study to show this channel of labour market insurance is operative for all children into middle age. 
      Further, I estimate a structural lifecycle model of individuals who can insure against unemployment risk via saving or moving home. 
      Consumers choose a submarket within a directed search framework which further influences their unemployment risk. 
      I find that for the average worker the option to move home is equivalent in welfare terms to a tripling of the unemployment insurance benefit.
