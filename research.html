    Living at Home: Non-Market Insurance and Labour Market Risk <br> 
    Over the past several decades, housing costs have risen rapidly relative to incomes. In a similar
time period, multigenerational households with at least two adult generations have also become
increasingly common. Existing literature suggests that young adults use the choice to move home
with a parent as an insurance mechanism against labour market risk, while new evidence from
the Health and Retirement Study indicates that this insurance behaviour persists for workers into
middle-age. I estimate a quantitative model of job search and parental coresidence to evaluate the
welfare gains of this channel relative to traditional forms of unemployment insurance as well as
characterize worker search behaviour in the context of this previously under-examined insurance
mechanism. <br>

      Living at Home: Non-Market Insurance and Labour Market Risk
    </div>

    <p>
      In 2023, more than half of renter households spent above 30\% of their gross income on housing costs. 
      Non-discretionary spending on durables such as housing exacerbates consumption losses while unemployed and induces self-insurance via moving home with a close family member. 
      This labour market insurance motive is evidenced in Kaplan (2012) which shows non-college young men aged 17-22 use the option to move home with a parent as a form of labour market insurance. 
      I use data from the Health and Retirement Study to show this channel of labour market insurance is operative for all children into middle age. 
      Further, I estimate a structural lifecycle model of individuals who can insure against unemployment risk via saving or moving home. 
      Consumers choose a submarket within a directed search framework which further influences their unemployment risk. 
      I find that for the average worker the option to move home is equivalent in welfare terms to a tripling of the unemployment insurance benefit.
