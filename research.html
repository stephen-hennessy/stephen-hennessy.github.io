      Moving Home: Non-Market Insurance and Labour Market Risk
    </div>

    <p>
      In 2023, more than half of renter households spent above 30% of their gross income on housing costs. 
      Non-discretionary spending such as housing exacerbates consumption losses while unemployed and induces self-insurance via moving home with a close family member. 
      This labour market insurance motive is evidenced in Kaplan (2012) which shows non-college young men aged 17-22 use the option to move home with a parent as a form of labour market insurance. 
      I use data from the Health and Retirement Study to show this channel of labour market insurance is operative for all children into middle age. 
      Further, I estimate a structural lifecycle model of individuals who can insure against unemployment risk via saving or moving home. 
      Consumers choose a submarket within a directed search framework which further influences their unemployment risk. 
      I find that for the average worker the option to move home is equivalent in welfare terms to a tripling of the unemployment insurance benefit.

      Parental Altruism and Transfers 
    </div>

    <p>
      This paper investigates the determinants of financial transfers from parents to adult children, with a focus on reconciling a key empirical puzzle: conditional on receipt, parental transfers are increasing in child income, a pattern inconsistent with typical models of intergenerational consumption smoothing. 
      Using microdata from the Health and Retirement Study (1998–2018), I document robust patterns in the extensive and intensive margins of transfers with respect to child incomes. 
      I show that while the likelihood of receiving a transfer declines with child income, the size of transfers rises with child income for most parent income groups. 
      I develop a static model of parental altruism to highlight the tension between two mechanisms: altruistic parents reduce transfers as children become richer, but wealthier parents—whose children are also likely to have higher incomes give larger transfers. 
      Allowing for heterogeneity in parental altruism allows the model to match both extensive margin and the average transfer, but cannot reproduce the positive relationship of the intensive margin with respect to child income.
